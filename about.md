My name is **Parsa Mohammadian**. I am studying for a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering at [the Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/). My research interests are:

- Distributed Systems
- Computer Networks
- Operating Systems
- Internet of Things
- Embedded Systems

If you are interested in my background, you can see my up-to-date CV on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/hsmhfcdxktbh).

As a computer scientist, I have always enjoyed studying theoretical computer science, but I find myself more mighty in the practical aspects. I admire the open-source mindset. I prefer to use open-source alternatives and open-source my projects whenever possible. My ultimate professional goal is to create something of value and better the future of mankind.

## On-Going Research Projects

### WIDESim (B.Sc. Thesis)
>**Distributed and Multi-agent Systems Laboratory, Sharif University of Technology**
>
>**Supervisor: Dr. Mohammad Izadi, Dr. Hajar (Maryam) Siar**

WIDESim is a toolkit for simulating resource management techniques of scientific Workflows in Distributed Environments with graph topology. It is written in Java based on the [CloudSim]() simulator. The development is finished, and we are currently working on the paper.

### Metaheuristic Fog Scheduling
>**Cyber-Physical Systems Laboratory, Sharif University of Technology**
>
>**Supervisor: Dr. Mohsen Ansari**

The fog computing environment is a distributed system that consists of a large number of heterogeneous devices. Scheduling resources in the fog computing environment is a challenging problem. Metaheuristic algorithms, on the other hand, can be used to find near-optimal solutions for optimization problems in a reasonable amount of time. That makes them a perfect candidate for solving the fog scheduling problem. In this project, we are trying to compare the performance metaheuristic algorithms (specifically [Artificial Gorilla Troops Optimization]() and [Reptile Search Algorithm]()) with the state-of-the-art algorithms in the fog scheduling problem using the [CloudSim]() simulator.

## Other 

As a human being, I am always curious about the world around me. I love reading about history and philosophy. I think being born in Iran, a country with a rich history and literature, was a great gift for me. I also love bodybuilding, running, and chess.

I love talking to people. Feel free to message me if you want to chat about life, university, computers, or anything else. You can find me by the username `parsa2820` everywhere I go.
